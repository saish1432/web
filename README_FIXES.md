# Microsite Fixes Applied - Complete Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Admin Logout Fixed
- **Problem**: Admin logout not working properly
- **Solution**: Created proper `admin/logout.php` file with complete session cleanup
- **File**: `admin/logout.php`

### ✅ 2. User Registration After Payment Fixed
- **Problem**: "I have paid" button not redirecting to register properly
- **Solution**: Enhanced payment flow with automatic order creation after registration
- **Files**: `assets/js/main.js`, `api/user-auth.php`

### ✅ 3. Order Tracking & Sales Analytics Fixed
- **Problem**: Orders not counting in sales until admin marks as paid
- **Solution**: 
  - Orders now track `payment_status` separately from `status`
  - Revenue calculations use `payment_status = 'paid'`
  - Admin can mark orders as paid to count in sales
- **Files**: `includes/functions.php`, `admin/dashboard.php`

- **Solution**: Filter orders to only show those after user registration
- **Files**: `assets/js/main.js`

### ✅ 6. Admin Password Change Fixed
- **Problem**: Password changes not saving, reverting to default
- **Solution**: Enhanced password verification and hashing
- **Files**: `includes/functions.php`

- **Problem**: Products showing twice on website after adding
- **Solution**: Enhanced product query to prevent duplicates
- **Files**: `includes/functions.php`, `admin/products.php`

### ✅ 10. Database Compatibility Fixed
